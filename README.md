- **admin**: Next.js admin panel for operations management

### Packages
- **ui**: Shared React components
- **config**: ESLint/TS/Prettier configuration
- **db**: Prisma schema + migrations
- **core**: Domain logic (pricing engine, NomadScore algorithm)

### Services & Infrastructure
- **api**: Next.js route handlers for REST+tRPC APIs
- **infra**: Docker, docker-compose configurations
